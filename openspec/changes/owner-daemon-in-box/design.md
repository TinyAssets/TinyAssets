# Design: the owner's daemon in the owner's box

## Shape check against the research (required for every slice)

| Research rule | This design |
|---|---|
| The shared door authenticates, maps the identity to an instance, forwards, and never reads tenant data | Router: identity → `owner_id` → box socket; no owner file or database path in the shared process (D7 guard) |
| Isolation is infrastructure, not shared-code filters | The gVisor box per owner with a null netns and its own uid and quota; no cross-owner checks in shared code |
| Secrets stay outside the instance; egress goes through a proxy | Broker credential and egress proxy; the box has no raw secrets (C6 P5) |
| The clock is outside, the rows are inside | The box keeps its schedule rows; the shared index keeps only `next_wake_at` |
| A flag lives with its reader and has one writer | Pause, heartbeats and the ledger are box state; account suspension is router state |
| Durable truth survives the instance | The box tree on an XFS volume, plus off-host snapshots (C6 P6/S27) |
| Cross-tenant views are published data, not reads of private stores | Commons publishing copies out at publish time; the listing reads only the caller's own box |

Any finding in review that can't be expressed as a defect in the router, the
broker proxy or the waker belongs inside one box. It is fixed there, never by
adding a check in shared code.

## D1. The owner daemon

- **Process:** the same image and code, with entrypoint `python -m tinyassets.owner_daemon
  --data /home/owner/data --socket /run/owner/app.sock
  --secret-file /run/owner/secret`. It runs
  inside the owner's gVisor box under the owner's uid. `data_dir()` is the
  owner's root. It serves the existing ASGI app (`/app/api/*`,
  `universe_server` MCP routes, `/api` handlers) on the unix socket, not TCP.
- **Single owner:** the code paths stay as they are. With only one owner's
  rows present, the shared root databases (`.tinyassets.db`, `.runs.db`,
  `.automations.db`) become that owner's databases, and the tick sees one
  owner. No multi-tenant filter is added or needed.
- **Agent loop:** runs in-process, so tools are local filesystem and exec
  inside the box (the existing `universe_tools`). The exec bridge is deleted.
- **Outbound:** the null netns is kept. Model calls, connections and
  webhooks-out go to the broker over a socket bound into the box (one per
  box), which injects credentials. Provider CLIs run in the box, as on main.
- **What it gets from the shared layer:** the authenticated `owner_id` (the
  router sets it, and the box trusts only the router's per-box secret), the
  plan tier, and published commons reads, all through the broker socket.

### D1 decisions from the slice 1 stop (2026-10-16)

- **Bootstrap.** The per-owner relay accepts first frame `{"op":"WHOAMI"}` without a center and returns `{"op":"OWNER_IS","principal":<bound owner>,"uid":<bound uid>}` from `bind()`, with no broker round trip or request identity; this admits startup as `owner-box`, while `BOX_CONNECT` stays unchanged.
- **Mode.** Missing or refused relay admission prevents startup; only successful admission installs immutable process-local owner mode; file helpers return no session binding in that mode, and the same app factory and existing request authentication remain in use until slice 2.
- **Tools.** Local file tools call `OwnerBoxd` in-process with generation/receipt state under `<data>/.owner-boxd`; bash launches locally with bounded output/time and the existing ta receipts and extension delivery over a local socket, without `BoxExecutor` or `start_exec`.
- **Authority.** Provider-work receipts accept `owner-box` alongside `cloud`; the executor class is derived from process admission, with no request-selected identity.
- **Egress.** `owner_runtime.broker_egress` is the slice 3 seam; slice 1 tests use the existing synthetic model-wire fixture.
- **Lifespan.** The existing app lifespan starts and stops the existing owner tick and loopback engine endpoints in owner mode; it needs neither host bootstrap protection nor a second box-facing engine socket.
- **Defaults.** Admitted owner startup enables the existing app-door and engine-tool flags; sandbox status uses that admission, and storage measurement walks the local owner root.
- **Loopback.** The `bash`/`ta` engine transport uses loopback TCP inside the
  box's own netns. That is allowed. The rule is no NON-loopback connection.

## D2. Shared router

- Keeps the public doors (Cloudflare tunnel → `/mcp`, `/app`, `/api`,
  `/hooks/inbound`), WorkOS sign-in, MCP OAuth and API keys.
- **Per request:** authenticate → `owner_id` → box (broker `owner_machine`)
  → `ensure_awake` → stream the request to the box socket with headers
  `X-Owner` and `X-Box-Secret`. Streaming MCP and SSE pass through unchanged.
  The router parses no owner payload.
- Reads no owner data. Commons and published listings come from its own
  published store.

### D2 decisions (slice 2)

- **Transport.** One ASGI reverse proxy streams request bytes and raw response chunks over HTTP on a Unix socket, removes hop-by-hop headers, preserves MCP session headers, and closes the upstream on client disconnect; it never retries an owner request.
- **Resolution.** Fenced `OWNER_BOX_ROUTE(principal, rotate)` returns only the broker-reserved uid and secret for an owner with a live center admission; a reservation alone is not admission, and unknown/retired owners return 404 without opening a socket.
- **Socket.** The single `resolve_box` seam uses `TINYASSETS_BOXES_RUN/<broker uid>/app.sock` (default `/run/boxhostd`); slice 4 adds waking there without changing route handlers.
- **Secret.** Admission mints a 256-bit per-owner secret in the broker's private identity database; explicit rotation replaces it, and owner startup requires `--secret-file`, whose value is checked with `hmac.compare_digest` on every request.
- **Identity.** The router replaces caller-supplied `X-Owner`, `X-Box-Secret` and `X-Owner-Identity`; the last carries the existing authenticated identity and capability metadata, while public bearer/cookie credentials are removed before forwarding.
- **Sessions.** Existing protected-owner cookies resolve only through the router session map; cookie-authenticated mutations retain exact-origin JSON admission, and the verified protected-view proof travels with the authenticated identity for box-local consumers.
- **Placement.** Router authentication resolves credentials only; MCP payload checks, outside capability admission and connection receipts run inside the owner daemon, and router logging never buffers owner payloads.
- **Hook map.** The router's `.hook-owners.sqlite3` contains only token digests and owners; the migration seeds existing digests and slice 3 supplies box publication/revocation over the shared-state broker seam, while payload/delivery rows remain inside the box.
- **Startup.** The shared entrypoint no longer starts owner recovery, engine endpoints, ticks or storage initialization and refuses direct SSE/stdio serving; owner recovery moved into the existing owner lifespan.
- **Routes.** All owner-facing `/app/*` routes (including `/app/api/*`, home, chat, uploads and preferences), `/api` and descendants, MCP transport `/mcp[/]` and `/mcp/events`, and `/hooks/inbound/<token>` (plus the existing `/mcp/hooks/<token>`) share the forwarder; discovery, sign-in/OAuth, pulse, published listing reads and billing retain router handlers.

### D3 decisions (slice 3: broker egress)

- **Transport.** Existing synchronous and streaming broker clients open `BOX_CONNECT` on the startup-admitted relay; the broker derives identity, center and fence from `BOX_CHANNEL`, with no host-client fallback.
- **Models.** Reuse the HTTP model executor, source/grant queries, accounting gate and credit-bounded `OPEN` stream; publish only validated, credential-free source descriptors into the broker ledger before inference.
- **Accounting.** An allocation holds a dedicated box channel with a ten-second heartbeat; the broker holds its liveness locks and releases them on disconnect, so accounting never reads a box file or depends on a host copy of it.
- **Connections.** Expose the existing bounded ledger, catalog, capability, HTTP-connect, disconnect and usage operations on the admitted box channel; credential refresh cannot fall back to daemon-side vault access.
- **Policy.** Policy reads, receipts, classification, decisions and proposals use the channel-bound owner; protected policy writes and approval issuance remain at the shared protected door.
- **CLIs.** Provider CLIs refuse in owner mode until `auth.mode: broker_endpoint` is implemented; no credential home or token is mounted into the box.
- **Shared reads.** `BOX_SHARED` uses the relay-bound owner without a center and exposes only named plan and published-definition/catalog reads; plan rows live in `.broker/plans.db`, published data in `.published/`, and slice 6 seeds these shared stores at cutover.
- **Enforcement.** Install one Python socket audit hook at owner startup for direct connects, datagrams and DNS; only loopback IPs/localhost and Unix channels are allowed, while the existing null netns remains the native-process boundary.
- **Custody.** Startup rejects the existing platform-secret inventory and provider/OAuth credential environment names; owner-mode credential-vault access and local billing-store access refuse rather than create or read a box-local secret store.

## D3. Lifecycle (boxhostd)

- boxhostd supports one persistent sandbox per owner, running the owner
  daemon with its socket bind-mounted to `/run/boxhostd/<uid>/app.sock`.
- It wakes on a router request or on the waker. It sleeps after N minutes
  idle with no running turn, and the daemon flushes on SIGTERM.
- It restarts on a crash, with backoff.
- Memory: each box gets a cgroup cap. A cap on concurrently awake boxes
  queues wakes (8 GB host).

## D4. Waker

- At the end of every tick the box reports its `next_wake_at` to the
  broker. The shared waker wakes boxes when it comes due.
- Suspended accounts (billing or abuse) are never woken.
- Delivery is at least once, so the tick is idempotent, as today.

## D5. Billing

- Stripe webhooks land at the router. Plan state is kept in the shared
  billing store, keyed by `owner_id`.
- The box reads its tier from the broker. It never holds a Stripe secret.

## D6. Migration (one cutover, after a verified full backup)

For each admitted owner:

1. Start from the owner's box tree. The C6 move already copies center trees
   in.
2. Move that owner's per-center platform files (conversation, pending, runs,
   pause, ledger and so on) into the box root.
3. Extract that owner's rows from each shared root database into the box
   root's database of the same schema. The key is the owner principal or the
   owner's center ids.
4. Verify counts and integrity, then remove the host per-center directories.

Any row or file the census cannot attribute to exactly one owner refuses the
cutover. The `--archive` rehearsal on the private production copy must:

- show the per-owner row counts summing to the original totals;
- show each owner daemon serving that owner's history, pending requests and
  pause after the move;
- prove a restore of the paired backup returns today's layout.

## D7. Guard and deletions

- Guard test: the router package imports no owner store module and opens no
  path under `data_dir()` other than its own shared stores.
- Deleted: per-center host dirs; `box_tools` exec bridge; `file_binding`
  owner routing; daemon-side `_call_writer` placement; cross-owner listing
  filters; multi-owner tick loop.

## D8. Shared stores stay shared, owner stores move (review gap 1)

The migration classifies every table of every shared root database:

- **Router store:** identity and WorkOS mapping, API keys and their owner,
  MCP OAuth clients and tokens, inbound hook token → owner, the canary
  account, published commons records.
- **Broker store:** `owner_identities`, `center_admissions`, `box_records`,
  credential custody, billing and plan state.
- **Owner box:** every table whose rows belong to one owner, split by owner
  principal or center id.

The census refuses only on an unknown table, or an owner-table row that
cannot be attributed. Shared tables are not split.

## D9. Router state, the per-box secret and the socket (review gaps 2, 3)

- `/hooks/inbound` and `/api` keys resolve to an owner from the router's
  own maps. That is router state.
- The router resolves owner → box socket only through broker admission
  (`owner_machine`), never from a request field.
- The broker mints the per-box secret when the box is admitted and rotates
  it on every box start. boxhostd passes it into the box as a read-only file.
  A restored box gets a fresh secret on its first start.

## D10. Waker floor and the interactive priority (review gaps 4, 5)

- The waker keeps the last reported `next_wake_at` until it is replaced, and
  wakes every admitted, unsuspended owner at least once every 24 hours. A box
  that dies before reporting is still woken.
- At the awake cap, an interactive request evicts the least recently used
  idle box. Scheduled wakes queue behind interactive requests.

## D11. Deploys, canary and rollback (review gaps 6–8)

- **Deploy:** the router rolls a new image per box. It waits until the box
  has no running turn, restarts it on the new image, health-checks it, and
  rolls back that box alone if the check fails. The router itself deploys as
  today.
- **Canary:** the canary account signs in through the router and runs one
  turn in its own box. That is the per-deploy acceptance.
- **Cutover rollback:** after the first owner-box write, the old image can't
  run on the split data. Rollback is restore-from-backup only, within the
  cutover's maintenance window.

## Founder decisions (2026-10-16)

- Build what the research says to build.
- A co-admin of a shared center is refused, as the research recommends by default. Sharing is by publishing.
- Features not ported into the owner daemon at cutover are dropped. The list is reported to the founder before the cutover deploy.
