# Owner isolation

## Purpose

Define source integrity and crash-resume requirements for the owner-box cutover.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Cutover repairs only named index drift

Census SHALL run the shared SQLite integrity policy read-only and report solely
index-only failures as repairable. Stopped apply SHALL run that same policy after
the verified paired backup, REINDEX exactly the named indexes, re-check integrity
and record each repair. Every non-index integrity failure SHALL refuse.

#### Scenario: Missing index entries with intact table
- **WHEN** integrity_check reports only missing entries or wrong entry counts in named indexes
- **THEN** census remains ready with repairable indexes listed and no source writes
- **AND** apply reindexes those indexes and records verified repairs

#### Scenario: Corrupt table alongside index drift
- **WHEN** any integrity error is not an index-only entry error
- **THEN** census and apply refuse without attempting index repair

#### Scenario: Resume with protected shared storage
- **WHEN** stopped apply or its retry opens a daemon-owned source database under a root-owned sticky data directory
- **THEN** named index repair remains writable without changing source database ownership or weakening directory protection
- **AND** stopped apply takes root custody of existing single-link regular WAL/SHM files without discarding their bytes or relaxing modes, and refuses aliases before changing custody
- **AND** interruption after an owner tree or shared seeding can resume on the same host
- **AND** independent archive rehearsal trials restore the archived data-root ownership and mode as well as its contents
