/**
 * The owner object's schema, migrated on wake.
 *
 * `schema_version` holds one row: how many of `MIGRATIONS` this object has applied.
 * The constructor applies the rest in order inside `blockConcurrencyWhile`, each in
 * its own transaction with its version bump, so a crash mid-way leaves a whole number
 * of migrations applied. A stored version past this code's list stops the object
 * loudly: code older than its data never runs against it.
 *
 * A migration is append-only. Once deployed it never changes; a new shape is a new
 * entry at the end.
