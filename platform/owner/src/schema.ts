/**
 * The owner object's schema, migrated on wake.
 *
 * `schema_version` holds one row: how many of `MIGRATIONS` this object has applied.
 * The constructor applies the rest in order inside `blockConcurrencyWhile`, each in
 * its own transaction with its version bump, so a crash mid-way leaves a whole number
 * of migrations applied. A stored version past this code's list stops the object
 * loudly: code older than its data never runs against it.
 *
 * A migration is append-only. Once deployed it never changes; a new shape is a new
 * entry at the end. Nothing is deployed yet, so migrations 1 and 2 are still edited in
 * place.
 *
 * The `CHECK` on a row body is the store's fixed ceiling of 65,536 characters. The
 * primitive's own bound is `LIMITS.maxRow`, which may be lower but never higher (a
 * test ties the two); raising the ceiling is a new migration.
